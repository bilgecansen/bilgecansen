## Hi there 👋

📈 I'm a **quantitative conservation ecologist** with a life-long passion for translating integrative research into clear and actionable science and conservation products. 

🌍 My expertise is building statistical models to associate ecological responses with environmental change. I use these models to predict population trends and changes in community compositions, and also to inform conservation management under global change. 

🕶️I have especially had the chance to work with exotic species that face unique conservation threats, such as **the Egyptian vulture**, **Adélie penguin** and **emperor penguin**. 

🥶 Currently, I'm building biodiversity models for **benthic communities in the Arctic** to assess their predictability and to provide guidance for the efficiency of Arctic monitoring programs.
